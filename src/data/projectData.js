            "Arbiter Report audits the impact of news articles and media orgs. in online information-sharing ecosystems such as social platforms. It is able to identify networks of accounts promoting content in a coordinated manner. This technology uses statistical methods to imbue accountability to the sharing of digital content, and understand the nature of how information spreads online. It supports the creation of public deliberation mechanisms for measuring the influence of accounts in the disjoint social ecosystem. The basis of this technology is the evaluation of content-agnostic sharing behavior in addition to heterogeneous datasets which allows it to generalize to different communities, languages, and countries without the need to explicitly provide local context. We develop and release these audits through an open-access platform that will allow users to review the spread of news on multiple social platforms.",
