# React Web App README

## Introduction

Welcome to the React Web App! This README file will guide you through the steps to set up, run, and develop the application. This app is built using React and requires Node.js version 16.20.2.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 16.20.2
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the React web app on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Archit1706/simppl-org
cd simppl-org
```

### 2. Install Node.js Version 16.20.2

Ensure you are using the correct Node.js version. You can manage multiple Node.js versions using tools like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

#### Using nvm

1. Install nvm if you haven't already: (linux)

    ```bash
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
    ```

2. Install Node.js 16.20.2:

    ```bash
    nvm install 16.20.2
    ```

3. Use Node.js 16.20.2:

    ```bash
    nvm use 16.20.2
    ```

4. Verify the Node.js version:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

   You should see:

    ```
    v16.20.2
    ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will launch the app and open it in your default web browser. If it does not open automatically, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### 5. Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `build` folder with the optimized application.

### 6. Testing

To run the test suite, execute:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will run all tests defined in the project.

## Development Guidelines

### Folder Structure

The project's folder structure is organized as follows:

```

│   ├── pages/
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js
